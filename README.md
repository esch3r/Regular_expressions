# Regular_expressions

Regular expression is a special-purpose language for defining and searching for patterns contained within string data.
The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not all possible string processing tasks 
can be done using regular expressions. This repo contains tutorials how to  use regular expressions in Python with the re module
more on regular expressions in Python; refer to the regular expression [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for many more examples and details
